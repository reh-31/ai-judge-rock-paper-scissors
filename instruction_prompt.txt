Judge this round.

Context:
- round_number: {{ROUND}}
- user_bomb_used_already: {{USER_BOMB_USED}}
- bot_move: {{BOT_MOVE}}
- bot_bomb_used_already: {{BOT_BOMB_USED}} (this is informational; user judgment still must follow rules)

User input (free text):
{{USER_TEXT}}

Return JSON with EXACTLY these keys:
{
  "round_number": number,
  "user_input": string,
  "intent": "rock" | "paper" | "scissors" | "bomb" | null,
  "decision": "VALID" | "INVALID" | "UNCLEAR",
  "reason": string,
  "turn_wasted": boolean,
  "user_bomb_used_now": boolean,
  "bot_move": "rock" | "paper" | "scissors" | "bomb",
  "round_winner": "USER" | "BOT" | "DRAW",
  "what_happens_next": string
}

Winner rules:
- If decision is INVALID or UNCLEAR → turn_wasted=true → USER loses the round unless BOT also effectively wasted (BOT never wastes in this setup), so BOT wins.
- If VALID:
  - Apply rock/paper/scissors normally.
  - bomb beats everything.
  - bomb vs bomb is DRAW.
Also, if intent is "bomb" but user_bomb_used_already is true → decision must be INVALID and turn_wasted=true.

Keep "what_happens_next" as a short instruction to the user for the next round.
Return JSON only.
